stylists i complained to the first article about the training of the information on introductory classes .
classes three experts in the field ; advice on clothes for unusual shapes ; and a seminar on how it works in real life .
the closer we final exam , the more information and practical tasks ahead of us .
at this time with аленкой , director ( on the course , no one man we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetric .
a short neck , another a boyish figure without appropriate forms another weighs more .
we were given tips on how to highlight figure women like jennifer lopez , i.e. , more lush обладательниц chest and hips and narrow waist , and not to dress too provocatively .
you do n't regret the invested funds as the ideal of clothing is invaluable .
обладательницы мальчишеских figures on the other hand , can wear clothing with рюшами аппликацией , embroidered or folds .
and yet i fear , is too much , given homework which we received .
we should take their current appearance , their style of clothes and figures .
i am happy with yourself , because her dress is easier than , say , britney spears , christina агилеру , which recently recovered per ton ( please keep in mind that i exaggerate , or very young селену gomez .
мудборд so - called work then reflects our own style and attitude to graphic image .
stylist not just the real people , but a food pages in magazines ( based on the specific guidelines , for example , hip bags , coats , etc. ) .
saturday lecture about the types of figures , and three guests specialists in the field .
якуб reminded us that fashion , this is an illusion and stylist should use this .
another to - roll up sleeves or raise collar , and the image changes .
however , i most appreciate following advice : " for your work , you ideally need to know the rules . "
i finally realized why we зубрим all definitions and rules that combined with what and why , then as we often see in fashion magazines .
from ben , a photographer , i have learned that a stylist for should have more options than the number of photos show that he needs to be done .
i also know that the image of clothing often looks and works in conjunction with other not so , as in reality .
the хонза confirmed that often image and style , half of success .
linked to stylists in the czech republic -- still pretty cool .
and if someone is finally allows us to establish their style , we should expect that they say we have another ( less ) than the amount that they really are .
sunday хонза and mario emphasis on that for the stylist did enough to be in fashion and be able to outfit .
to be able to see people who do n't condone it and stick to their opinion .
" find at least a couple of things you can praise and encourage that , can carry with them , " says mario .
this bag , that you 're повязываете around the waist , to carry everything .
to distract from the lessons and get some experience , we have learned to do , the soles of shoes .
i understand that being a stylist not so easy , whatever .
ambitions were to some extent , but it does not matter because no one does not want to do extra work .
she expected that the previous series need for speed in a new direction ; the demo version of that game will take place in racing game .
as often happens with nfs , in a much different from what we expected .
and , in fact it 's not mistakes , and display of inexplicable laziness .
you become part of history , whose protagonist jack , decides to some personal problems with participating in illegal race across america .
this means that every race is on his route , separate phases are diverse and interesting environment .
despite the fact that the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series , it is pleasant to look at some of the pipeline .
while driving through the desert in the autumn suburbs or in the snow - covered mountains , very nice .
in the wilderness , for example , you are in a sandstorm have снижающую visibility .
for a while you 're trying to pass a few rivals ( essentially a race ) ; then you try to improve the standard race with секундомером ) ; or you 're up against one opponent .
in fact , it turns out that game is good because the property is not boring ; given all this , it is one of the things that make entertaining .
this means it no longer represents something special , but it cannot be a drawback .
and yet this model is driving very suited for dynamic races , while the market could find better options .
from this game does not expect complex transformation and clashes , but if you are not a clash with the object , how your car , something not so .
перезапуски designed so that if you leave or разбиваетесь far off the game returns you to the point where she broke off .
if you use them , you have to start the race since the start .
sometimes перезапусков under a separate section of race , and you need to learn by heart .
for example , some turn to be a certain way , because you do n't впишетесь .
this is especially annoying in situations when you see how your opponent easy rides between the two cars , moving in the opposite direction , whereas when you are , there already are , so that you need them to bypass or lose speed .
this is particularly evident in the late game on a bridge , where you are going in the opposite direction .
in fact , when he is in front of you , it affects you review leads to one or more accidents on the area .
sorry , because despite a model driving , занимательна and sometimes so full of events that you do n't have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
the main story mode closely associated with the challenge mode ; this race to individual sites , you will see during the game .
many opportunities are available for high - level drive : ranging from cars to data .
here is another downside , difficult to understand ; it 's an example of the race in succession .
your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km / h ( so ) we think that , when suddenly налетает metro train back on you , your car into a pile of scrap metal .
technical component of the game is not anything ; but the overall impression from sequences mostly sweet , sometimes shocking .
this is especially accident with a large number of participants , where a record you do not have helped , too .
broader youth audience as possible to please , the soundtrack 'вошли composition of different styles ' ; but it is unlikely many people buy the game because of its music .
if game avoided the unnecessary mistakes , we could honestly say that running is the best part of the nfs in recent years .
of course , it 's good fun , but you get ready for that shortcomings ослепят , floodlights at the airport .

so , czech tourists went on holiday in the german democratic republic of crimea ; the soviet union ( sochi , on the black sea ) ; bulgaria ; romania ( both on the black sea ) ; hungary ( zagreb ) .
it was a great paradox of the socialist period , that socialist bloc citizens ( and czechoslovakia ) were not allowed individual tour of the socialist countries .
at the time travel agencies offered travel to the west , but had to either stand in the queue all night , with travel bag , or a " friends " in the agency .
currency needed permission to travel to the west . him were not politically unreliable people who do n't have been allowed to travel .
most czechs have their holiday home that led to a large number of houses and summer homes , this habit is to this day .
while the pre - 1989 vacation in germany or bulgaria was the culmination of our holiday travel , the czechs had 4.5 million last year in countries around the world .

йиндржих райхл , and miroslav пельта tomash пацлик are lead czech football .
however , the era гашека again plunged football association in the fighting between the two chambers , who can choose the candidate .
delegates meeting that came in the national house in prague смихов because negotiations were blocked off , not only the election .
this moment since then , was partially settled with the recommendation of state , and the right to representation , based on the power , it is impossible .
executive board also has not helped , although their meetings , both regular and early , he mainly engaged in this matter .
the question is : how to move to the three - round and avoid a pat ?
based on the model , under the charter , winner of the 3rd round of a candidate , received more support for the house , which is the candidate .
czech side insists on condition that the overall percentage must collect at least two - thirds vote .
a few unexpected tomas пацлик agrees with his opinions , although the election rules , charter , with пельту more than other candidates .
" i want to avoid всевозможной of stupidity , as the previous meeting , " said the owner of victoria пльзень , which is the candidate ; and for the first time in his remarks , he mostly contradicts пельте .
he believes that the new president will be known нимбурке ; he hopes that cooperate in the future will be constructive .
" football will again be a happy wave of people will be more willing to cooperate , " said representative яблонеца . of the three candidates had more experience in football management at both the professional and the regional level .
" i hope the agreement , but the situation is very divided . "
not so much time left to the parties reached an agreement .
additional flight , which was supposed to , among other things , vice - presidents далибора coachman and райхла подгорицу , flew from prague in the morning because of technical malfunctions . sought an alternative , to get part of the executive committee to переигровочного match .
the minister of education , youth and sports , josef добеш , would like to hand - opponents of the most powerful sports association agreed in the country .
пацлик into presidential campaign , because he sees suitable candidate
" if it was a candidate , i 'd fought for him and he was not involved in fighting . "
motive пацлика to join the fight against miroslav пельтой and йиндржихом райхлом - try to prevent пельте предположительному contender , managing fačr elections .
in the future he would like to see this post has experienced senior manager , not too connected with football .
" it was terrible for me to hear some of them said at the moment they do n't want to do with czech football . "
currently , the main disagreement пацлика with пельтой connected with the relationship last with novel бербром , president of the football association in the regional бербр - a controversial reputation behind the scenes is known as an influential lobbyist , can affect the delegates of the general assembly .
" if he wins , the current situation will remain unchanged , and football will not move forward . "
he refers to the fact that a few years ago name пельты was recorded during the phone with the investigation of corruption ; пельте was avoided .
" as we would look in the eyes of uefa and fifa , " said пацлик . now he does not mention his previous statement about the fact that he will sell the club пльзень if пельта becomes president . "
this view is shared , another candidate , райхл пацлик supported the general assembly in september , the ceausescus .
пацлик argues that it risk management association .
" i have to make football environment change to back her changes for the better . "
one of his priorities will be strengthening relations between fačr and czech olympic committee , with the help he would lobby at the highest political level for more money on the sport of lottery money .
" if taxes on gambling , according to the political party , i understand their arguments , but they should be clear , funds , " he said .
пельта яблонецем with , but prague дуклой райхл .
" and yet i do n't see the point of hypocritical of my shares of the club пльзень someone else , i 'm going back six months , " says пацлик .
for two days before the general assembly of the football association , one of the presidential candidates , miroslav пельта promised that if elected , he will fight for new rules fačr , in order to avoid future disputes over election rules .
before september пельта проваленных elections promised that if he wins , as he focuses on representation , and on funding .
" people at all levels has been in football , and they expect the president will be known on thursday . "
it gives grounds to believe that it is enough to control the czech football .
" unfortunately , the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought , were the general assembly in june . "
he has rewritten a document civil association as the false target for delegates .
" this is a question , without which we do n't exist , " said пельта . "
in the past , he has claimed that he can submit its cooperation with йиндржихом райхлом , whom he values for legal education ; he is the fact that his candidate 's rival should be his first vice - president .
" he was in football , and achieved some success " .
" more and so some now doubt his true identity , " said пельта конкуренте . пельта claims that he himself faithful declarations , which announced in september .
" after that i would have on the negotiations with both private and public sectors , to ensure enough money for the football , " сорокашестилетний candidate čtk said two months ago .
" i will need to know the individual . " it was his message страхову instructions , a lengthy period междувластия creates understandable nervousness .
" if only the question is how to vote in the third round , we can cope . "
райхл promises that under his leadership will work actively fačr
райхл promises that if elected , comes the hard work .
he also promises to solve богемцев ; improve relations with both uefa and fifa , to raise more money in football ; and continue the previous president , ivan гашека .
" international contact from uefa and fifa , national team , professional soccer and football activities for young people . "
" i 'm a team player , and i want to distribute authority executive committee , so that each member on the field . "
" it probably wo n't many people , as it will mean hard work and not just criticism of the other , " he added .
" i know that i work 20 hours a day . "
" however , many people told me that i should n't give up , or other " .
furthermore , he said that his motivation to continue work , he began гашеком .
processes that can deliver the results were launched after a few years , and i do n't want someone else to stop them , " he said , fearing that if another candidate , miroslav пельта , will be elected , the situation in the association could return to that was гашека .
" it is surrounded by people who were football , so he was available only for the " .
moreover , he denied accusations that he will be president of the czech republic .
" for example , it is time to think about sharing the league and the czech моравскую winners of which continue to struggle in the league " .
while in the presidential campaign joined the club пльзень tomas пацлик райхл did not dare to assess his chances of victory .
on the other hand , he partially blames himself that the association is unity .
" nobody can doubt that he worked in the this year . "
" it would n't facts to his benefit , " said райхл about his opponent .
